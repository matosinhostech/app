## üì± App

In a simple way, this app, is a showcase of <b>matosinhos.tech</b> events, partners and videos.<br />

Nevertheless, it's much more than that.<br />
It's intended to work as a learning platform for anyone who wants to do open source and an example of what this community can build.

## üèñ Community

Our community is composed of the most varied members of the tech industry.<br />
Engineers, students, tech leads, managers, directors, CTO's but above all, people who want to learn.

Here you'll learn, experiment, and discover how technology shapes industries.<br />
As a result, we'll create a platform of sharing and contribute to a community that grows stronger together.
